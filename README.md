# U-Net_Image_segmentation
U-Net image segmentation project

# Overview
## Goal

The Goal of this project is to perform image segmentation on the OxfordIIITPets dataset using Pytorch using a machine learning model. 
Our model's architecture is based off of the U-Net described in the paper: " U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation"

### Architecture From the paper
The overall architecture from the original paper is a fully convolutional neural network that is similar to an autoencoder. 
The model can be viewed as 9 "blocks" of convolutional layers with different functions between them.
